in the struggle for life by charles darwin ma frs author of the descent of man etc etc sixth london edition with all additions and corrections but with regard to the material world we can at least go so far as thiswe can perceive that events are brought about not by insulated interpositions of divine power exerted in each particular case but by the establishment of general laws whewell bridgewater treatise the only distinct meaning of the word natural is stated fixed or settled since what is natural as much requires and presupposes an intelligent agent to render it so ie to effect it continually or at stated times as what is supernatural or miraculous does to effect it for once butler analogy of revealed religion to conclude therefore let no man out of a weak conceit of sobriety or an illapplied moderation think or maintain that a man can search too far or be too well studied in the book of gods word or in the book of gods works divinity or philosophy but rather let men endeavour an endless progress or proficience in both bacon advancement of learning an historical sketch of the progress of opinion on the origin of species previously to the publication of the first edition of this work i will here give a brief sketch of the progress of opinion on the origin of species until recently the great majority of naturalists believed that species were immutable productions and had been separately created this view has been ably maintained by many authors some few naturalists on the other hand have believed that species undergo modification and that the existing forms of life are the descendants by true generation of pre existing forms passing over allusions to the subject in the classical writers1 the first author who in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was buffon but as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods and as he does not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species i need not here enter on details 1 aristotle in his physicæ auscultationes lib2 cap8 s2 after remarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn grow any more than it falls to spoil the farmers corn when threshed out of doors applies the same argument to organisation and adds as translated by mr clair grece who first pointed out the passage to me so what hinders the different parts of the body from having this merely accidental relation in nature as the teeth for example grow by necessity the front ones sharp adapted for dividing and the grinders flat and serviceable for masticating the food since they were not made for the sake of this but it was the result of accident and in like manner as to other parts in which there appears to exist an adaptation to an end wheresoever therefore all things together that is all the parts of one whole happened like as if they were made for the sake of something these were preserved having been appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity and whatsoever things were not thus constituted perished and still perish we here see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth but how little aristotle fully comprehended the principle is shown by his remarks on the formation of the teeth lamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much attention this justly celebrated naturalist first published his views in 1801 he much enlarged them in 1809 in his philosophie zoologique and subsequently 1815 in the introduction to his hist nat des animaux sans vertébres in these works he up holds the doctrine that all species including man are descended from other species he first did the eminent service of arousing attention to the probability of all change in the organic as well as in the inorganic world being the result of law and not of miraculous interposition lamarck seems to have been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of species by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties by the almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups and by the analogy of domestic productions with respect to the means of modification he attributed something to the direct action of the physical conditions of life something to the crossing of already existing forms and much to use and disuse that is to the effects of habit to this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful adaptations in nature such as the long neck of the giraffe for browsing on the branches of trees but he likewise believed in a law of progressive development and as all the forms of life thus tend to progress in order to account for the existence at the present day of simple productions he maintains that such forms are now spontaneously generated2 2 i have taken the date of the first publication of lamarck from isidore geoffroy sainthilaires hist nat générale tom ii page 405 1859 excellent history of opinion on this subject in this work a full account is given of buffons conclusions on the same subject it is curious how largely my grandfather dr erasmus darwin anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of lamarck in his zoonomia vol i pages 500510 published in 1794 according to isid geoffroy there is no doubt that goethe was an extreme partisan of similar views as shown in the introduction to a work written in 1794 and 1795 but not published till long afterward he has pointedly remarked goethe als naturforscher von dr karl meding s 34 that the future question for naturalists will be how for instance cattle got their horns and not for what they are used it is rather a singular instance of the manner in which similar views arise at about the same time that goethe in germany dr darwin in england and geoffroy sainthilaire as we shall immediately see in france came to the same conclusion on the origin of species in the years 17945 geoffroy sainthilaire as is stated in his life written by his son suspected as early as 1795 that what we call species are various degenerations of the same type it was not until 1828 that he published his conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since the origin of all things geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the conditions of life or the monde ambiant as the cause of change he was cautious in drawing conclusions and did not believe that existing species are now undergoing modification and as his son adds cest donc un problème à réserver entièrement à lavenir supposé même que lavenir doive avoir prise sur lui in 1813 dr wc wells read before the royal society an account of a white female part of whose skin resembles that of a negro but his paper was not published until his famous two essays upon dew and single vision appeared in 1818 in this paper he distinctly recognises the principle of natural selection and this is the first recognition which has been indicated but he applies it only to the races of man and to certain characters alone after remarking that negroes and mulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases he observes firstly that all animals tend to vary in some degree and secondly that agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by selection and then he adds but what is done in this latter case by art seems to be done with equal efficacy though more slowly by nature in the formation of varieties of mankind fitted for the country which they inhabit of the accidental varieties of man which would occur among the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle regions of africa some one would be better fitted than others to bear the diseases of the country this race would consequently multiply while the others would decrease not only from their in ability to sustain the attacks of disease but from their incapacity of contending with their more vigorous neighbours the colour of this vigorous race i take for granted from what has been already said would be dark but the same disposition to form varieties still existing a darker and a darker race would in the course of time occur and as the darkest would be the best fitted for the climate this would at length become the most prevalent if not the only race in the particular country in which it had originated he then extends these same views to the white inhabitants of colder climates i am indebted to mr rowley of the united states for having called my attention through mr brace to the above passage of dr wells work the hon and rev w herbert afterward dean of manchester in the fourth volume of the horticultural transactions 1822 and in his work on the amaryllidaceæ 1837 pages 19 339 declares that horticultural experiments have established beyond the possibility of refutation that botanical species are only a higher and more permanent class of varieties he extends the same view to animals the dean believes that single species of each genus were created in an originally highly plastic condition and that these have produced chiefly by intercrossing but likewise by variation all our existing species in 1826 professor grant in the concluding paragraph in his wellknown paper edinburgh philosophical journal vol xiv page 283 on the spongilla clearly declares his belief that species are descended from other species and that they become improved in the course of modification this same view was given in his fiftyfifth lecture published in the lancet in 1834 in 1831 mr patrick matthew published his work on naval timber and arboriculture in which he gives precisely the same view on the origin of species as that presently to be alluded to propounded by mr wallace and myself in the linnean journal and as that enlarged in the present volume unfortunately the view was given by mr matthew very briefly in scattered passages in an appendix to a work on a different subject so that it remained unnoticed until mr matthew himself drew attention to it in the gardeners chronicle on april 7 1860 the differences of mr matthews views from mine are not of much importance he seems to consider that the world was nearly depopulated at successive periods and then restocked and he gives as an alternative that new forms may be generated without the presence of any mold or germ of former aggregates i am not sure that i understand some passages but it seems that he attributes much influence to the direct action of the conditions of life he clearly saw however the full force of the principle of natural selection the celebrated geologist and naturalist von buch in his excellent description physique des isles canaries 1836 page 147 clearly expresses his belief that varieties slowly become changed into permanent species which are no longer capable of intercrossing rafinesque in his new flora of north america published in 1836 wrote page 6 as follows all species might have been varieties once and many varieties are gradually becoming species by assuming constant and peculiar characters but further on page 18 he adds except the original types or ancestors of the genus in 184344 professor haldeman boston journal of nat hist u states vol iv page 468 has ably given the arguments for and against the hypothesis of the development and modification of species he seems to lean toward the side of change the vestiges of creation appeared in 1844 in the tenth and much improved edition 1853 the anonymous author says page 155 the proposition determined on after much consideration is that the several series of animated beings from the simplest and oldest up to the highest and most recent are under the providence of god the results first of an impulse which has been imparted to the forms of life advancing them in definite times by generation through grades of organisation terminating in the highest dicotyledons and vertebrata these grades being few in number and generally marked by intervals of organic character which we find to be a practical difficulty in ascertaining affinities second of another impulse connected with the vital forces tending in the course of generations to modify organic structures in accordance with external circumstances as food the nature of the habitat and the meteoric agencies these being the adaptations of the natural theologian the author apparently believes that organisation progresses by sudden leaps but that the effects produced by the conditions of life are gradual he argues with much force on general grounds that species are not immutable productions but i cannot see how the two supposed impulses account in a scientific sense for the numerous and beautiful coadaptations which we see throughout nature i cannot see that we thus gain any insight how for instance a woodpecker has become adapted to its peculiar habits of life the work from its powerful and brilliant style though displaying in the early editions little accurate knowledge and a great want of scientific caution immediately had a very wide circulation in my opinion it has done excellent service in this country in calling attention to the subject in removing prejudice and in thus preparing the ground for the reception of analogous views in 1846 the veteran geologist mj domalius dhalloy published in an excellent though short paper bulletins de lacad roy bruxelles tom xiii page 581 his opinion that it is more probable that new species have been produced by descent with modification than that they have been separately created the author first promulgated this opinion in 1831 professor owen in 1849 nature of limbs page 86 wrote as follows the archetypal idea was manifested in the flesh under diverse such modifications upon this planet long prior to the existence of those animal species that actually exemplify it to what natural laws or secondary causes the orderly succession and progression of such organic phenomena may have been committed we as yet are ignorant in his address to the british association in 1858 he speaks page li of the axiom of the continuous operation of creative power or of the ordained becoming of living things further on page xc after referring to geographical distribution he adds these phenomena shake our confidence in the conclusion that the apteryx of new zealand and the red grouse of england were distinct creations in and for those islands respectively always also it may be well to bear in mind that by the word creation the zoologist means a process he knows not what he amplifies this idea by adding that when such cases as that of the red grouse are enumerated by the zoologist as evidence of distinct creation of the bird in and for such islands he chiefly expresses that he knows not how the red grouse came to be there and there exclusively signifying also by this mode of expressing such ignorance his belief that both the bird and the islands owed their origin to a great first creative cause if we interpret these sentences given in the same address one by the other it appears that this eminent philosopher felt in 1858 his confidence shaken that the apteryx and the red grouse first appeared in their respective homes he knew not how or by some process he knew not what this address was delivered after the papers by mr wallace and myself on the origin of species presently to be referred to had been read before the linnean society when the first edition of this work was published i was so completely deceived as were many others by such expressions as the continuous operation of creative power that i included professor owen with other palæontologists as being firmly convinced of the immutability of species but it appears anat of vertebrates vol iii page 796 that this was on my part a preposterous error in the last edition of this work i inferred and the inference still seems to me perfectly just from a passage beginning with the words no doubt the typeform cibid vol i page xxxv that professor owen admitted that natural selection may have done something in the formation of a new species but this it appears ibid vol iii page 798 is inaccurate and without evidence i also gave some extracts from a correspondence between professor owen and the editor of the london review from which it appeared manifest to the editor as well as to myself that professor owen claimed to have promulgated the theory of natural selection before i had done so and i expressed my surprise and satisfaction at this announcement but as far as it is possible to understand certain recently published passages ibid vol iii page 798 i have either partially or wholly again fallen into error it is consolatory to me that others find professor owens controversial writings as difficult to understand and to reconcile with each other as i do as far as the mere enunciation of the principle of natural selection is concerned it is quite immaterial whether or not professor owen preceded me for both of us as shown in this historical sketch were long ago preceded by dr wells and mr matthews m isidore geoffroy sainthilaire in his lectures delivered in 1850 of which a résumé appeared in the revue et mag de zoolog jan 1851 briefly gives his reason for believing that specific characters sont fixés pour chaque espèce tant quelle se perpétue au milieu des mêmes circonstances ils se modifient si les circonstances ambiantes viennent à changer en résumé lobservation des animaux sauvages démontre deja la variabilité limitée des espèces les expériences sur les animaux sauvages devenus domestiques et sur les animaux domestiques redevenus sauvages la démontrent plus clairment encore ces mêmes expériences prouvent de plus que les différences produites peuvent être de valeur générique in his hist nat générale tom ii page 430 1859 he amplifies analogous conclusions from a circular lately issued it appears that dr freke in 1851 dublin medical press page 322 propounded the doctrine that all organic beings have descended from one primordial form his grounds of belief and treatment of the subject are wholly different from mine but as dr freke has now 1861 published his essay on the origin of species by means of organic affinity the difficult attempt to give any idea of his views would be superfluous on my part mr herbert spencer in an essay originally published in the leader march 1852 and republished in his essays in 1858 has contrasted the theories of the creation and the development of organic beings with remarkable skill and force he argues from the analogy of domestic productions from the changes which the embryos of many species undergo from the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties and from the principle of general gradation that species have been modified and he attributes the modification to the change of circumstances the author 1855 has also treated psychology on the principle of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation in 1852 m naudin a distinguished botanist expressly stated in an admirable paper on the origin of species revue horticole page 102 since partly republished in the nouvelles archives du muséum tom i p 171 his belief that species are formed in an analogous manner as varieties are under cultivation and the latter process he attributes to mans power of selection but he does not show how selection acts under nature he believes like dean herbert that species when nascent were more plastic than at present he lays weight on what he calls the principle of finality puissance mystérieuse indéterminée fatalité pour les uns pour les autres volonté providentielle dont laction incessante sur les êtres vivantes détermine à toutes les époques de lexistence du monde la forme le volume et la durée de chacun deux en raison de sa destinée dans lordre de choses dont il fait partie cest cette puissance qui harmonise chaque membre à lensemble en lappropriant à la fonction quil doit remplir dans lorganisme général de la nature fonction qui est pour lui sa raison dêtre3 3 from references in bronns untersuchungen über die entwickelungsgesetze it appears that the celebrated botanist and palæontologist unger published in 1852 his belief that species undergo development and modification dalton likewise in pander and daltons work on fossil sloths expressed in 1821 a similar belief similar views have as is well known been maintained by oken in his mystical naturphilosophie from other references in godrons work sur lespèce it seems that bory st vincent burdach poiret and fries have all admitted that new species are continually being produced i may add that of the thirtyfour authors named in this historical sketch who believe in the modification of species or at least disbelieve in separate acts of creation twentyseven have written on special branches of natural history or geology in 1853 a celebrated geologist count keyserling bulletin de la soc geolog 2nd ser tom x page 357 suggested that as new diseases supposed to have been caused by some miasma have arisen and spread over the world so at certain periods the germs of existing species may have been chemically affected by circumambient molecules of a particular nature and thus have given rise to new forms in this same year 1853 dr schaaffhausen published an excellent pamphlet verhand des naturhist vereins der preuss rheinlands c in which he maintains the development of organic forms on the earth he infers that many species have kept true for long periods whereas a few have become modified the distinction of species he explains by the destruction of intermediate graduated forms thus living plants and animals are not separated from the extinct by new creations but are to be regarded as their descendants through continued reproduction a wellknown french botanist m lecoq writes in 1854 etudes sur géograph bot tom i page 250 on voit que nos recherches sur la fixité ou la variation de lespéce nous conduisent directement aux idées émises par deux hommes justement célèbres geoffroy sainthilaire et goethe some other passages scattered through m lecoqs large work make it a little doubtful how far he extends his views on the modification of species the philosophy of creation has been treated in a masterly manner by the rev baden powell in his essays on the unity of worlds 1855 nothing can be more striking than the manner in which he shows that the introduction of new species is a regular not a casual phenomenon or as sir john herschel expresses it a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process the third volume of the journal of the linnean society contains papers read july 1 1858 by mr wallace and myself in which as stated in the introductory remarks to this volume the theory of natural selection is promulgated by mr wallace with admirable force and clearness von baer toward whom all zoologists feel so profound a respect expressed about the year 1859 see prof rudolph wagner zoologischanthropologische untersuchungen 1861 s 51 his conviction chiefly grounded on the laws of geographical distribution that forms now perfectly distinct have descended from a single parentform in june 1859 professor huxley gave a lecture before the royal institution on the persistent types of animal life referring to such cases he remarks it is difficult to comprehend the meaning of such facts as these if we suppose that each species of animal and plant or each great type of organisation was formed and placed upon the surface of the globe at long intervals by a distinct act of creative power and it is well to recollect that such an assumption is as unsupported by tradition or revelation as it is opposed to the general analogy of nature if on the other hand we view persistent types in relation to that hypothesis which supposes the species living at any time to be the result of the gradual modification of preexisting species a hypothesis which though unproven and sadly damaged by some of its supporters is yet the only one to which physiology lends any countenance their existence would seem to show that the amount of modification which living beings have undergone during geological time is but very small in relation to the whole series of changes which they have suffered in december 1859 dr hooker published his introduction to the australian flora in the first part of this great work he admits the truth of the descent and modification of species and supports this doctrine by many original observations the first edition of this work was published on november 24 1859 and the second edition on january 7 1860 contents an historical sketch of the progress of opinion on the origin of species

species introduction when on board hms beagle as naturalist i was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the organic beings inhabiting south america and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent these facts as will be seen in the latter chapters of this volume seemed to throw some light on the origin of speciesthat mystery of mysteries as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers on my return home it occurred to me in 1837 that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it after five years work i allowed myself to speculate on the subject and drew up some short notes these i enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions which then seemed to me probable from that period to the present day i have steadily pursued the same object i hope that i may be excused for entering on these personal details as i give them to show that i have not been hasty in coming to a decision my work is now 1859 nearly finished but as it will take me many more years to complete it and as my health is far from strong i have been urged to publish this abstract i have more especially been induced to do this as mr wallace who is now studying the natural history of the malay archipelago has arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that i have on the origin of species in 1858 he sent me a memoir on this subject with a request that i would forward it to sir charles lyell who sent it to the linnean society and it is published in the third volume of the journal of that society sir c lyell and dr hooker who both knew of my workthe latter having read my sketch of 1844honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish with mr wallaces excellent memoir some brief extracts from my manuscripts this abstract which i now publish must necessarily be imperfect i cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements and i must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy no doubt errors may have crept in though i hope i have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone i can here give only the general conclusions at which i have arrived with a few facts in illustration but which i hope in most cases will suffice no one can feel more sensible than i do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in detail all the facts with references on which my conclusions have been grounded and i hope in a future work to do this for i am well aware that scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which facts cannot be adduced often apparently leading to conclusions directly opposite to those at which i have arrived a fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each question and this is here impossible i much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of acknowledging the generous assistance which i have received from very many naturalists some of them personally unknown to me i cannot however let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep obligations to dr hooker who for the last fifteen years has aided me in every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellent judgment in considering the origin of species it is quite conceivable that a naturalist reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings on their embryological relations their geographical distribution geological succession and other such facts might come to the conclusion that species had not been independently created but had descended like varieties from other species nevertheless such a conclusion even if well founded would be unsatisfactory until it could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified so as to acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which justly excites our admiration naturalists continually refer to external conditions such as climate food c as the only possible cause of variation in one limited sense as we shall hereafter see this may be true but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions the structure for instance of the woodpecker with its feet tail beak and tongue so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees in the case of the mistletoe which draws its nourishment from certain trees which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds and which has flowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects to bring pollen from one flower to the other it is equally preposterous to account for the structure of this parasite with its relations to several distinct organic beings by the effects of external conditions or of habit or of the volition of the plant itself it is therefore of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into the means of modification and coadaptation at the commencement of my observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out this obscure problem nor have i been disappointed in this and in all other perplexing cases i have invariably found that our knowledge imperfect though it be of variation under domestication afforded the best and safest clue i may venture to express my conviction of the high value of such studies although they have been very commonly neglected by naturalists from these considerations i shall devote the first chapter of this abstract to variation under domestication we shall thus see that a large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible and what is equally or more important we shall see how great is the power of man in accumulating by his selection successive slight variations i will then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature but i shall unfortunately be compelled to treat this subject far too briefly as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts we shall however be enabled to discuss what circumstances are most favourable to variation in the next chapter the struggle for existence among all organic beings throughout the world which inevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of their increase will be considered this is the doctrine of malthus applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms as many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive and as consequently there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence it follows that any being if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life will have a better chance of surviving and thus be naturally selected from the strong principle of inheritance any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form this fundamental subject of natural selection will be treated at some length in the fourth chapter and we shall then see how natural selection almost inevitably causes much extinction of the less improved forms of life and leads to what i have called divergence of character in the next chapter i shall discuss the complex and little known laws of variation in the five succeeding chapters the most apparent and gravest difficulties in accepting the theory will be given namely first the difficulties of transitions or how a simple being or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly developed being or into an elaborately constructed organ secondly the subject of instinct or the mental powers of animals thirdly hybridism or the infertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed and fourthly the imperfection of the geological record in the next chapter i shall consider the geological succession of organic beings throughout time in the twelfth and thirteenth their geographical distribution throughout space in the fourteenth their classification or mutual affinities both when mature and in an embryonic condition in the last chapter i shall give a brief recapitulation of the whole work and a few concluding remarks no one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in regard to the origin of species and varieties if he make due allowance for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of the many beings which live around us who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very numerous and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare yet these relations are of the highest importance for they determine the present welfare and as i believe the future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world still less do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the world during the many past geological epochs in its history although much remains obscure and will long remain obscure i can entertain no doubt after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which i am capable that the view which most naturalists until recently entertained and which i formerly entertainednamely that each species has been independently createdis erroneous i am fully convinced that species are not immutable but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species furthermore i am convinced that natural selection has been the most important but not the exclusive means of modification chapter i variation under domestication causes of variabilityeffects of habit and the use and disuse of partscorrelated

originprinciples of selection anciently followed their effectsmethodical and unconscious selectionunknown origin of our domestic productionscircumstances favourable to mans power of selection causes of variability when we compare the individuals of the same variety or subvariety of our older cultivated plants and animals one of the first points which strikes us is that they generally differ more from each other than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature and if we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment we are driven to conclude that this great variability is due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as and somewhat different from those to which the parent species had been exposed under nature there is also some probability in the view propounded by andrew knight that this variability may be partly connected with excess of food it seems clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations to new conditions to cause any great amount of variation and that when the organisation has once begun to vary it generally continues varying for many generations no case is on record of a variable organism ceasing to vary under cultivation our oldest cultivated plants such as wheat still yield new varieties our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification as far as i am able to judge after long attending to the subject the conditions of life appear to act in two waysdirectly on the whole organisation or on certain parts alone and in directly by affecting the reproductive system with respect to the direct action we must bear in mind that in every case as professor weismann has lately insisted and as i have incidently shown in my work on variation under domestication there are two factors namely the nature of the organism and the nature of the conditions the former seems to be much the more important for nearly similar variations sometimes arise under as far as we can judge dissimilar conditions and on the other hand dissimilar variations arise under conditions which appear to be nearly uniform the effects on the offspring are either definite or in definite they may be considered as definite when all or nearly all the offspring of individuals exposed to certain conditions during several generations are modified in the same manner it is extremely difficult to come to any conclusion in regard to the extent of the changes which have been thus definitely induced there can however be little doubt about many slight changes such as size from the amount of food colour from the nature of the food thickness of the skin and hair from climate c each of the endless variations which we see in the plumage of our fowls must have had some efficient cause and if the same cause were to act uniformly during a long series of generations on many individuals all probably would be modified in the same manner such facts as the complex and extraordinary out growths which variably follow from the insertion of a minute drop of poison by a gallproducing insect shows us what singular modifications might result in the case of plants from a chemical change in the nature of the sap in definite variability is a much more common result of changed conditions than definite variability and has probably played a more important part in the formation of our domestic races we see in definite variability in the endless slight peculiarities which distinguish the individuals of the same species and which cannot be accounted for by inheritance from either parent or from some more remote ancestor even stronglymarked differences occasionally appear in the young of the same litter and in seedlings from the same seedcapsule at long intervals of time out of millions of individuals reared in the same country and fed on nearly the same food deviations of structure so strongly pronounced as to deserve to be called monstrosities arise but monstrosities cannot be separated by any distinct line from slighter variations all such changes of structure whether extremely slight or strongly marked which appear among many individuals living together may be considered as the in definite effects of the conditions of life on each individual organism in nearly the same manner as the chill effects different men in an in definite manner according to their state of body or constitution causing coughs or colds rheumatism or inflammation of various organs with respect to what i have called the in direct action of changed conditions namely through the reproductive system of being affected we may infer that variability is thus induced partly from the fact of this system being extremely sensitive to any change in the conditions and partly from the similarity as kölreuter and others have remarked between the variability which follows from the crossing of distinct species and that which may be observed with plants and animals when reared under new or unnatural conditions many facts clearly show how eminently susceptible the reproductive system is to very slight changes in the surrounding conditions nothing is more easy than to tame an animal and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement even when the male and female unite how many animals there are which will not breed though kept in an almost free state in their native country this is generally but erroneously attributed to vitiated instincts many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour and yet rarely or never seed in some few cases it has been discovered that a very trifling change such as a little more or less water at some particular period of growth will determine whether or not a plant will produce seeds i cannot here give the details which i have collected and elsewhere published on this curious subject but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement i may mention that carnivorous animals even from the tropics breed in this country pretty freely under confinement with the exception of the plantigrades or bear family which seldom produce young whereas carnivorous birds with the rarest exception hardly ever lay fertile eggs many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless in the same condition as in the most sterile hybrids when on the one hand we see domesticated animals and plants though often weak and sickly breeding freely under confinement and when on the other hand we see individuals though taken young from a state of nature perfectly tamed longlived and healthy of which i could give numerous instances yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail to act we need not be surprised at this system when it does act under confinement acting irregularly and producing offspring somewhat unlike their parents i may add that as some organisms breed freely under the most unnatural conditionsfor instance rabbits and ferrets kept in hutchesshowing that their reproductive organs are not easily affected so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation and vary very slightlyperhaps hardly more than in a state of nature some naturalists have maintained that all variations are connected with the act of sexual reproduction but this is certainly an error for i have given in another work a long list of sporting plants as they are called by gardeners that is of plants which have suddenly produced a single bud with a new and sometimes widely different character from that of the other buds on the same plant these bud variations as they may be named can be propagated by grafts offsets c and sometimes by seed they occur rarely under nature but are far from rare under culture as a single bud out of many thousands produced year after year on the same tree under uniform conditions has been known suddenly to assume a new character and as buds on distinct trees growing under different conditions have sometimes yielded nearly the same varietyfor instance buds on peachtrees producing
